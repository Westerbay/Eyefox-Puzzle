					<h2>Eyefox Puzzle</h2>
					<h4>Flip tiles to match grids !</h4>
					<p>This project is a puzzle game developed in Java for Android. It was inspired by a game on the Nintendo DS and it is now available on the Google Play Store.</p>
					<p>It also was my first personal Python project developed during my bachelor's. You can check the python version on my <a href="https://westerbay.itch.io/eyefox-puzzle" target="_blank">Itch.io</a>. It was recreated for Android during a school project at ENSICAEN.</p>

					<h2>Rules : </h2>
					<p>Each level begins with two grids, one on the left and one on the right. The left grid shows the target configuration, while the right grid starts in a different state, with some tiles hidden and others revealed. </p>
					<p>Your goal is to make the two grids identical by swapping the color of a tile, which will also flip the colors of all its neighboring tiles. </p>
